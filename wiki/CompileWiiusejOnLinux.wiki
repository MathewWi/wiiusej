#summary Compile Wiiusej C part on linux

Page not finished yet!

= Introduction =

What packages you need installed: libc-dev, libbluetooth-dev, xlibmesa-gl-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev, libsdl.

You need Java 6 jdk installed, to get the jni interface.

You need to get `libwiiuse.so` compiled before trying to compile Wiiusej library.

= Wiiuse library =

  # First, [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=187194 download according version of Wiiuse] (for WiiuseJ v0.12, download Wiiuse v0.12).
  # Second, compile the Wiiuse lib `libwiiuse.so` 

{{{
make
make install
}}}

Here, if you did not install the sdl library, you may get a bug. The library is well-compiled anyway.

= Wiiusej library =
''Don't forget to replace my jdk folder by yours''

{{{
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libWiiuseJ.so -Wall -L. -lwiiuse -I/home/vincent/jdk1.6.0_05/include -I/home/vincent/jdk1.6.0_05/include/linux wiiusej_WiiUseApi.c
}}}

= Launch on linux =

Put both libs `libwiiuse.so` and `libWiiuseJ.so` in the folder of `wiiusej.jar`.

Now launch
{{{
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ~/jdk1.6.0_05/bin/java -Djava.library.path=. -jar wiiusej.jar
}}}
